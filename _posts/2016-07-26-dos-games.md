DOSBox emulates an Intel x86 PC, with sound, graphics, mouse, modem, etc., necessary for running old DOS games that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and OSs.

Ubuntu:
Open terminal window and type the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install dosbox
```
Once installed, type dosbox & to run it as a background process.

We can easily mount the /home/user/dos directory from DOSBox Z: prompt as:
```bash
mount c /home/user/dos
```
Let’s auto mount the drive so that we don’t have to mount it every single time.

At the DOSBox Z: prompt, type:
```bash
config -writeconf /home/user/dosbox.conf 
```
We now have the configuration file. Type exit to get back to your terminal session. Open the dosbox.conf file and scroll down to [autoexec] section. Add:
```bash
mount c /home/user/dos
```
Save and quit. Type in dosbox & and it should auto mount the c: drive.

We are done. Enjoy the games.

Mac:
Boxer is the DOS game emulator that’s fit for your Mac. Boxer is based on DOSBox’s DOS emulation code, but has evolved past the point of being a mere front-end.

P.S. I am currently playing Prince Of Persia on Ubuntu 12.10 VM running on OS X Mountain Lion.
