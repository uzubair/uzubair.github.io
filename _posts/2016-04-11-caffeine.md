There are times when you maybe uploading a YouTube video, downloading games on Steam and don’t want your Mac to fall asleep automatically. Instead of changing your Power Saver Preferences in System Preferences, you can use ‘caffeinate’ and command Mac to not fall asleep until you say so.

Open Terminal and paste the following command:
```bash
caffeinate
```

To give your Mac a break hit ‘Control + C’ in the Terminal or quit the Terminal altogether.

Now, to keep your Mac awake for specific time period. Use:
```bash
caffeinate -i -t {seconds}
```

So, if you need it to stay awake for 1 hour (1h = 3600s). Easy peasy. Right?
