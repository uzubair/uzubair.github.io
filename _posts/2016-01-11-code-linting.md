Linting is the process of checking the source code for any Programmatic as well as Stylistic errors. This is helpful in identifying common mistakes that
are made during coding.

A `Lint` or `Linter` is a program that supports linting. Some of the useful linters that I have used are:

#### Java

- Findbugs: It find bugs, detects common coding mistakes and misuse of API methods in Java program
- PMD: It basically scans source code and find potential problems like bugs, dead code, duplicated code, suboptimal code, and overcomplicated expressions

#### EsLint
It is easily extensible, comes with a large number of custom rules. Easy to debug since the output includes the rule name causing the error by default
Note: Others are JSHint and JSLint

#### Python

- pylint
- pyflakes
- pep8
- flake8
- pychecker
