                <p>After graduating from the University of Windsor’s Computer Science program in the Spring of 2006, I worked for PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation), IBM Toronto, Research In Motion (BlackBerry), OpenText, Aeryon Labs, Textnow before landing at Auvik Networks in January of 2019. I’ve worked primarily on web services with a focus on efficiency, scalability, automated testing, and maintainability.</p>
                <p>My interests include cloud computing, server-side development, software design patterns, and complex algorithms.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I’m a son, a brother, a husband, and a lover of music and movies. I play with Lego, video games on PS4, and spend far too much time on `reddit/r/programming`.</p>
